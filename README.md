### Lyrics Finder App

**Project Description:**
The Lyrics Finder App is a sleek and user-friendly application developed with React that allows users to search for song lyrics easily. This project leverages modern web technologies and best practices to provide a seamless experience for music enthusiasts who want quick access to their favorite songs' lyrics.
**Key Features:**

- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter the name of a song or an artist in the search bar to find lyrics. The app uses an external API to fetch and display accurate and up-to-date song lyrics.
- **Real-time Search Suggestions:** As users type in the search bar, the app provides real-time suggestions to enhance the search experience. 
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Favorites:** Users can save their favorite lyrics for quick access later. 
- **Lyrics Display:** Once a song is selected, the app displays the lyrics in a clean, readable format. Users can scroll through the lyrics and enjoy a distraction-free reading experience.  
- **Error Handling:** The app includes robust error handling to manage cases where lyrics are not found or the external API fails.

**Technologies Used:**
  
- **React:** The app is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for modular and maintainable code.  
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the lyrics API.  
- **React Router:** For handling routing within the app, allowing users to navigate seamlessly between different pages.  
- **CSS Modules:** For styling the components, ensuring scoped and maintainable CSS.
